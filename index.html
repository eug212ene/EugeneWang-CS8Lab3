        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Eugene Wang, and I am currently a student attending the University of California Riverside. I am originally from northern California. Much of my childhood was spent in Cupertino, the birthplace of Apple Computers. As a child, I had many differnt interests. From Chess Club to Football, I had a wide range of activites that I would participate in. As a youngster, I had a unique curiosity towards the inner workings of many different aspects of life. This could be a new toy that I received for Christmas, or the interactions that I witnessed between different people around me. I also had a very keen desire to help others and leave the environments that I came across better than I had first encountered them. One prime example of this that comes to mind is a time when I went on a family camping trip with my parents. I was still a fairly young child at the time, no older than ten years old. On one of the days that we were camping in Yosemite, we decided to venture down to a nearby creek. There, we were greeted by other families who had had a similar idea and were spending the mid morning hours cooling off in the small stream before lunch. All was going fine until I heard a piercing scream come from nearby. As I turned, I quickly assessed the situation and realized that a girl around my age had been stung by a bee. Naturally, she was in pain and had a barbed stinger protruding from her knee. Not knowing what else to do and allowing natural instinct to take over, I made my way over and calmly used my nails to delicately extract the stinger from her knee. This type of behavior has since been repeated a number of times throughout my life. I am not one to simply stand by idly and watch things happen. One other such example of this happened in middle school when my friend decided to microwave a frozen burrito. Unbeknownst to us, the heat sensor in the microwave was faulty or had malfunctioned. This resulted in the "automatic" cook setting to overheat the burrito to the point that thick smoke began billowing out of the microwave. I was the first one to notice and quickly ensured that all of my friends and I made it out of the house. I immediately called the fire department and the emergency was swiftly addressed and solved. At the time of both of these occurrences, I was unaware that they spoke volumes of my personality. I was simply "doing what had to be done." As I have grown though, I have realized that this may be a viable path for me to pursue in the form of becoming a deputy sheriff for the county of Riverside. I believe that it will allow me to channel my natural proclivity to help into tangible and real results for myself as well as those around me. I will be able to ensure the safety of my fellow Americans and that is one of the best callings.<br><br>

        Today, as I have previously mentioned, I am a psychology major at the University of California Riverside. My desire to understand the inner workings of everything around me has since blossomed into an emphasis on how people work. I have always been captivated by what causes us as humans to make the decisions that we do and commit the actions that we do. Specifically, I have become interested in the psychology behind crime and what leads people to sin in ways that are almost unimaginable. At the beginning of my college career, I enrolled as a biological engineering major in the Bourns College of Engineering. I registered and completed quite a few of the required classes. Some of these classes were the likes of chemistry and biology. However, it quickly dawned on me that biological engineering was not my true calling. There were many hints that alluded to this. The most obvious I believe, was the fact that I just simply was not happy. I figured that if I wasn't happy learning about the different concepts related to biological engineering that I would slowly grow to despise it. Once I graduated, I would then dislike any job that I was able to land. This mostly solidified my decision to switch majors. Another factor that influenced my decision was the fact that calculus simply wouldn't click. That being said, I knew that if I really buckled down, I'd be able figure it all out. After all, I had completed AP Calculus B/C in high school. However, going back to the previous point, I did not want to lock myself into a career that I would not enjoy. With all that in mind, I was faced with the decision about what major I was going to switch into. I knew that the possibilities were almost endless at UCR. I also knew that the arts were not my calling. Besides photography, I was basically inept with any kind of art. I had tried my hand at illustration, drawing, and painting in the past and I knew it definitely was not for me. Besides that, I was certain that I did not want to stick with any kind of engineering. The effort to benefit ratio was not worth it to me. That got me thinking about what interested me. Finally, I realized that my curiosity for understanding people was a great fit for psychology. Since then, I have taken a myriad of courses in the subject. Some of my favorites have been personality where we delved deep into what makes each person unique. I have also taken more technical and science based courses such as The Brain and Behavior. In this class, I learned what makes the brain tick in a sense. I was able to learn about how miniscule cells in our brains called neurons communicate with each other. I am currently taking another course that somewhat expands on these ideas. The course I am currently enrolled in is Neural Mechanisms of Animal Behavior. <br><br>

        As for future plans, I have a few options. As aforementioned, I am interested in becoming a deputy sheriff. However, there are both advantages and disadvantages to this line of work. On one hand, there is a strong brotherhood among those that make up the thin blue line between order and chaos. There is a camaraderie that is almost impossible to find in any other profession. Additionally, each day at work would be different with different calls and different people that I could have a positive impact on. On the flip side though, there are inherent dangers to becoming a law enforcement officer. Any call that I go on could potentially be my last and I would hate for any of my loved ones to receive “the call.” On top of that, the hours that I would work would be long and I would not be able to see family much. I want my future children to have a well-rounded upbringing and one of the only ways I can ensure this is if I  am present and able to help them not only on the academic aspect of life but also how to be a righteous human being. That leads me to my other options. I have not yet mentioned this, but I thoroughly enjoy working with my hands. In a way, this goes hand in hand with wanting to understand how different things work. Many of the things that I would look into were mechanical in nature. As a child this would be my foam flinging toys that I’d want to modify. As a I grew up a little more, I would dismantle my Rubik's Cubes to maintain them and understand how the pieces stayed in place while twisting and turning the puzzles. Now, I collect knives and different tools that help me be more prepared for day to day life. In an effort to not get too “in the weeds” about knives, I will say that there are an endless number of locking mechanisms that each work differently than the others. This fascinates me and I void warranties left and right simply to understand how a knife works. Because of all this, I believe that a profession in machining will suit me well. I love seeing a blank piece of titanium or metal slowly become shaped into more than just a paperweight. In tandem with that,  job in machining will open doors to different industries like defense. That way, I will still be serving my country and ensuring its safety while not putting myself immediately in harm’s way. I believe that whichever choice I end up making, I will have the work ethic and determination to see it through. With both options, there are both pros and cons, but my duty is to decide which of the pros outweigh the cons and if I truly see myself in a position of law enforcement or involved with the manufacturing of different components.
